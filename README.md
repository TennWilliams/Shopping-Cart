# Shopping-Cart
<img src="Screensho.jpg" width="700" height="400">
This is a grocery store cart where you added items to the cart and the instock number updates.  You can also delete items from the cart and instock number will update.  The count of items comes from the API database and it fecthed with an onclick button.

## Future improvments 
I want to add styling to this exercise and an alert message to make sure you want to delete an item from your cart.

## Run Code
You can run this exercise by cloning it and running it on a local http server.
